        <span class="title">My City "Antalya"</span>
        I was born on 10.12.1987 in Antalya. I completed my primary, secondary
        and high school education in Antalya. I became one of the most
        successful students in all the schools I attended. During this period, I
        was also interested in wrestling and football as an amateur. Because I
        was a village boy, I was good in swimming and hunting. Although there
        was an offer from a good football club, I decided to return to education
        only at my father's request. I got a good score in the university exam
        and won the English Mathematics Department of Zonguldak Karaelmas
        University.

        In 2005, I started a life apart from my family for the first time:
        Univercity. I completed the mathematics department in 5 years, the first
        year of which was basic English. During this time, I took part in
        various aid organizations voluntarily and gave free lessons. I took the
        turkey-wide exam for post-university master's degree. I entered the
        interview with a high score of 88, a very good English score and a
        diploma grade. but I couldn't get accepted because I didn't have any
        important acquaintances at the university. Then, I completed my
        pedagogical formation required for teaching in 2011-2012.

        <span class="title">First Job Experience</span>
        In September 2011, I started as a teacher in a private education
        institution in Zonguldak. I was promoted to manager because I was
        successful in only 1 year and I worked as a manager and a teacher in the
        same institution until 2015. I always showed different and practical
        solutions to the students, not in the usual system. I taught a logicist,
        not a rote, and became a successful and loved person in a short time.

        <span class="title">FIRST STEP INTO BUSINESS</span>
        When I became a successful and loved one in my teaching career, I
        decided on a school to found that would evaluate children as human
        beings rather than as a race horse, which is innovative and intertwined
        with technology, apart from the classical system. I started with only 20
        students in May 2015 and in just 1 year I became an institution with the
        most successful students in the province. Last year, all the important
        names had lined up to send their kids to my school.

        <span class="title">Fall From Top to Bottom</span>
        It's good that everything went well, but life isn't always fair. The
        government had gone mad and began sacking and jailing anyone who did not
        support it. I was arrested in July 2016 because the private company I
        worked for criticizes the government and I worked for that company years
        ago. And for this ridiculous reason, they took everything and sent me to
        prison. I was in prison for 1.5 years and unfortunately hundreds of
        thousands of people like me were in the same situation. Desperate and we
        couldn't do anything

        <span class="title">Building a New Life</span>
        A difficult life awaited me after prison. The government no longer
        allowed me to teach and confiscated all my property. I had a family and
        3 young children, so I could not sit idle. In 2018, I started as a
        manager in a shopping company and was promoted in a short time. But the
        government forced this company and they fired me. For a while, I went to
        work for a daily wage. Then I decided to start a cow farm. I didn't know
        anything, but I could learn quickly. I started with only 3 cows and
        before I came to Switzerland I had about 50 cows. It was easy for me to
        come up with new practical ideas. It was enough for me to just
        understand the field I work in. I was successful in this Job in a short
        time.

        <span class="title">Very Difficult Decision</span>
        I made good money, but I didnt risk going back to prison. The government
        was increasing the pressure day by day. Worse still, my children were
        growing up and their future was not looking good either. I was also
        forbidden to go abroad. We were psychologically worn out and made a
        decision to Continiue in another country. It would be a very dangerous
        and difficult journey. I had to do this for my family. First, I went to
        Greece by escaping and then to Switzerland, which I have always heard
        good things about, and applied for asylum there.

        <span class="title">A New World: Switzerland</span>
        Switzerland first accepted me and then my family. 6 months later, my
        family came and we settled in Switzerland. From 0 level to b2 level in 2
        years my german evolved . I bought Bootcamp from an American company and
        became a Fullstack Java Developer. At the same time, I got about 30
        certificates from different places on the internet. I did an internship
        in both the backend and frontend department in the same company and now
        I only need one thing. A Job. i will find it and i believe it i will be
        successful in switzerland too
